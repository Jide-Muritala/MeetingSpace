      <h5><strong>About us</strong></h5>
      <p>Welcome to our app designed to help you find the perfect meeting space! We are Margarita, Francisco, Jide, and Michael, and we designed this app as our final project for the Le Wagon bootcamp.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our team has diverse backgrounds and experiences, but we all share a passion for creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. During the bootcamp, we identified a common pain point shared by many people: finding a suitable meeting space. Whether you're a freelancer looking for a quiet coffee shop, or a small business owner in need of a professional conference room, the process of finding and booking a meeting space can be time-consuming and frustrating.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's why we decided to develop an app that streamlines this process and helps you find the perfect meeting space for your needs. Our app allows you to search for meeting spaces, view photos, read reviews from previous users, and book your preferred space.
          <br>
          <br>
          We believe that finding the perfect meeting space should be easy and stress-free and our team worked tirelessly to ensure that our app is user-friendly, efficient.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thank you for using our app, and we hope it helps you find the perfect meeting space for your next important meeting or event.
